# efficient_frontier

In this repository I have posted a short code enabling the user to import data of stock prices from yahoo_api and then construct their efficient frontier using different weighting schemes produced by a random iterative process. I have added an input() method which allows the user to directly ask for the specific tickers' prices and to define the specified time periods. The process which produces the weights is currently set to 1000 iterations. Mind that application of upwards of 50000 iterations renders the time needed for completion of the process quite long.
